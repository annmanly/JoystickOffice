        - World Prefab This world prefab is instantiated when the world is loaded on both client and server. This prefab will be instantiated only once and acts as a bootstrap for worlds. The default world prefab will automatically load the first scene in the scenes list and move all players into that scene.
        - Scene Prefab The scene prefab is automatically instantiated when any scene other than the world scene is loaded. This prefab generally contains functionality for controlling the player, etc, that is common within your game.
        - Hide Virtual Player Scenes This option when enabled will hide the additional scenes that are loaded in the hierarchy window when using virtual players. This is on by default, disable if you want to debug issues occurring in your virtual players scenes.
        - Scenes To facilitate multiple scene support you can now list the scenes you want included in your world here as well as some meta data such as the loading screen to use when switching.
